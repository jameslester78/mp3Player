# mp3Player

A very, very basic mp3 player, the purpose of which was just to explore tk interface and understand how I can use it to build a GUI frontend for a python application.

To use the mp3 player, add mp3 files to the tracklist using the "add songs" button and hit the play button.

Songs can also be played by double clicking the song title in the track list display.

Additionally you have the option to save your current track list to a play list or load a premade tracklist via the Playlist menu.

To use the mp3 player please install pygame, tinytag and tkinter (an optional feature when installing python)
